* talk yet to do
** cut some history
** assess each slide for talking points
** tighten up link between history, FR, and elixir
** where does "produce/process" definition go?
** code examples and context
*** libcluster: more context
*** hot code loading: pic of rpi and temp sensor
*** better graphic for "background work"/supervision
*** phoenix channel: hammer this down
** reflections
*** otp is great, it is not magic
*** you have to design
*** the world is messy, iteration is messy
*** elixir doesn't do everything, it's great at controlling
*** don't prematurely break apart. break apart when faults emerge
** wrap
** process: go forward, 30 years
** FR, come talk to me,
